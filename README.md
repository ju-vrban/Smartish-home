# Smart-ish home project

This is my smart-ish home project, using the STM F429 nucleo board and an asortment of sensors to monitor temperature of the rooms, water temperature, forceful entry. Also it controlls the lights around the house, raises and lowers the blinds, sounds the alarm in case of forcefull entry or the presence of dangerous gasses.

It is very much a project in development and is not guaranteed to work.
